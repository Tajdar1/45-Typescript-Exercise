//42.	Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
//  Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians
//  by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name.
//  Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified 

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]){
    magicians.forEach(name => console.log(name));
}
// function make great modifies arry by map
function make_great(magicians: string[]){
    return magicians.map(name => `The Great ${name}`);

}

let megicians_names = ["Sarim","Qasim","Okasha"]

let great_magicians = make_great(megicians_names)

show_magicians(great_magicians)
